## Source Code

These projects [exist as pure client-side JavaScript](docs/), servable from a static server (and using an embedded [three.js](https://threejs.org/) render layer). They connect to a Google server for cloud storage and multiplayer room management.

The original [Freed Series](http://www.lewcid.com/lg/lc/freed.html) was written in C++ over OpenGL and GLUT. This project includes their ([C++ source code](cpp/)), those level designs were exported as the [v1 JSON descriptions](v1/), and imported into the web versions.
